	<h1>Built-In Templates</h1>
	<p>
		In order to make building pages easier for users, we've provided many built-in templates we
		think will be useful for a wide variety of web pages.

	<h2>More Features</h2>
	<p>
		Because built-in templates are more controlled, they allow for a greater range of actions to be
		taken. This may include fetching resources over the network and processing them, running code
		such as Javascript, etc.
	</p>
	<h2>Performance</h2>
	<p>
		On average, these built-in templates should be more performant as it will come bundled with the
		website code.
